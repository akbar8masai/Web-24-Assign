<h1> b tag</h1>
<p>
    The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.

<h2> i tag

<h3>

<h4>
select tag
</h4>
<p>
    The <select> element is notoriously difficult to style productively with CSS. You can affect certain aspects like any element â€” for example, manipulating the box model, the displayed font, etc., and you can use the appearance property to remove the default system appearance.

        However, these properties don't produce a consistent result across browsers, and it is hard to do things like line different types of form element up with one another in a column. The <select> element's internal structure is complex, and hard to control. If you want to get full control, you should consider using a library with good facilities for styling form widgets, or try rolling your own dropdown menu using non-semantic elements, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA to provide semantics.
